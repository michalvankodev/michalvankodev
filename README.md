# michalvankodev

Hi!

I'm passionate about software development. I've been programming web-applications since I was 14 years old.

## Github repositories

Feel free to browse my repositories. Many of them are really old and outdated not finished side-projects. I used them to test some theories and architectures.

## twitch stream

I stream on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/michalvankodev) almost every **Tuesday and Thursday** and occasionally on weekends. I like to talk to people about development and share valuable tips live.
I usually code some little utilities or work on my blog and would like to also start a game development series.
I plan on learning game development with [rust bevy engine](https://bevyengine.org)
**Come hang out in the chat** and get to know me bit better.

## Blog

Check out my [blog](https://michalvanko.dev) where I write various [guides](https://michalvanko.dev/blog/tags/Guide) and tips on [development](https://michalvanko.dev/blog/tags/Development) as well as personal stuff regarding my developer lifestyle.
